I thought about sharing it to help other ND students who, like me, must go over the process of picking a project, and make it happen! This can be a daunting decision given the immense possibilities out there, so I hope this helps others on cohorts after me. In my case I decided to go with a project that took me away from my comfort zone as a mean to not only practice the ML concepts, but also to challenge me to gain Domain Knowledge in an industry that I look forward to getting involved with.\n","\n","The project information is located on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lambertopisani/Udacity_ML_Projects/tree/master/6_Capstone). You'll see my other projects I created along the Nanodegree so feel free to review all of them and provide any input or guidance to improve them.\n","\n","This notebook/kernel was modified from its original version, so it can work on Python 3 (the project was based on Python 2.7). \n","The objective of the project was(is):\n","*This project’s objective is to define directionality of the closing price of a ETF instrument “M” days in the future relative to its daily closing price i.e. whether its price is predicted to increase (up) or decrease (down).*\n","\n","Many of the studies I evaluated during my initial research had similar characteristics. Below what I found on the studies and, to share with you some background in the decision-making process I followed, I also include what I ended up doing:\n","- Most studies were dedicated to company stocks, Because I was trying to look for a \"safer\" investment vehicle, I selected Technology ETFs as opposed to specific individual company stocks. Also, by predicting on each ETF, we could pick the \"best\" performing one.\n","- Most studies defined rather \"fixed\" values to generate some of the features of the analysis (i.e. momentum of the ETF is dependent of the number of days picked, which was fixed in most studies).  This made me wonder why or how this decision was made, how would the author know whether 10 days is better than 25 for calculating momentum to maximize the performance of their ML algorithm. Because of this I decided to follow a Sensitivity Analysis-like process that would allow me to confidently pick the best set of \"momentum durations\" that would maximize model's performance\n","- Another item I did notice during my research is that Accuracy was used as evaluation metric for most, if not all of the studies. Accuracy suffers if the data is skewed, hence, I decided to use a evaluation metric that performs better under skewed data conditions: the AUC_ROC curve.\n","\n","As part of my ML \"pipeline\" on my local PC, I evaluated Neural Networks as well, however, for this kernel, I skipped the NN algorithm because it enlengthens the running time by quite a bit.\n","\n","Well, enough introduction, let’s dig in!\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"a87f6b6da0487327376abc4da73761fddb046fec"},"source":["# *LOAD LIBRARIES AND INITIALIZE VARIABLES*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"evalue":"Error: Jupyter cannot be started.
